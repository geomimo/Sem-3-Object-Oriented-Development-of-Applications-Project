# Object-Oriented Development of Applications Project - 2018
Assessment Project for the course "Object-Oriented Development of Applications" of 4th semester, Department of Informatics - University of Piraeus.

The "ErgasiaAtomiki" is a individual project in WinForms C#. I had to create a game in which the player has to click a random-appearing symbol. There are 3 difficulty levels, each with different speed and time of the symbol "pop up". Scores and leaderboard are also included.
